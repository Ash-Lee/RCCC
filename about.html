                        <h1>About us</h1>
                        <p>Rotherham Cancer Care Centre believes that people affected by cancer have individual needs that cannot always be fully addressed by their health care providers and social support networks. The centre which opened in Rotherham in 2004 provides a place for people to go to talk, and someone to help them deal with the way cancer has affected them and their life. People sometimes struggle to talk openly to their family and friends for fear of upsetting them. The centre provides a safe environment for people to share their feelings and fears.</p>

                        <p>A diagnosis of cancer can give rise to a vast array of concerns and these may occur at any stage of the disease. Our patients are extremely positive about the care they receive from their medical teams, however some also benefit from extra care and support away from a medical environment. They may also need to regain control of their situation and to improve their quality of life, but do not know where to turn for help.</p>
                        <p>The Rotherham Cancer Care is dedicated to providing free integrated care and support to people with cancer. Our highly trained and experienced staff understand the effects of cancer on people's lives and are used to working with people at all stages of illness. Whether you have cancer yourself or provide full time care for someone who has, we are here for you. Our tailored support includes a combination of complementary therapies and/or counselling to suit your individual requirements.</p>

                        <p>Cancer is an illness that affects the whole family on a daily basis – everyone is “living with it”. Many patients experience ongoing difficulties and find it difficult to cope physically, practically and psychologically. Patients and their families often require support to reach a point where there is an acceptance of their diagnosis and the impact it has had on themselves and those closest to them. They may also need to take control of their situation in order to improve the quality of their life. It is in this scenario, where people are at their most vulnerable and do not know where to turn. In such cases, the Rotherham Cancer Care Centre offers an open door and a friendly welcoming environment.</p>
                        <p>If you would like to register as a new client, arrange a visit or simply learn more about the centre, please get in touch.</p>

                        <p>You will always be warmly welcomed on your arrival. Your first visit to the centre will be to meet with a dedicated professional assessor, who will listen to your concerns and help you to sort out your thoughts. Together you will look at the options available and decide how we can best support you. Assessors provide a vital link between you and your therapist, hospital consultant, GP and Specialist Nurse.</p>
                        <h3>What kind of therapies do you provide?</h3>
                        <p>Our range of therapies are aimed at helping you to regain control and so improve the quality of your life. For details of the therapies we currently provide, please see our support section. As the centre expands a wider range of therapies will be introduced. After a number of therapy sessions you will see your assessor again to review your progress.</p>
                        <h3>How much do your services cost?</h3>
                        <p>Our services are provided completely free of charge. We rely on our dedicated team of fundraisers, volunteers and Charitable Trusts to help raise the funds we need to deliver our care and support packages.</p>
                        <h3>Is my personal information confidential?</h3>
